        With six in-house licensed Professional Engineers and an entire team of designers and drafters, our exclusive team of seasoned professionals can provide an exemplary design for your next project whether in Oregon or Washington. Our engineering team has experience with a wide range of industry related tasks such as ETO rebates and analysis, LEED and Earth Advantage documentation, and code compliance documentation. In addition, our in-house CAD and BIM capabilities offer you a substantial cost and performance advantage. When our engineering team utilizes Revit to complete your design, that model can be employed in Navisworks to complete clash detection exercises with other trades. We have found that this process in highly successful in alleviating conflicts in the field, resulting in on-time and on-budget construction. These models can then be utilized in SysQue to begin the pre-fabrication process, which is outlined in further detail in the Construction section of our website.
