         <p><strong>Scope of Work: </strong>HVAC work for newly remodeled 911 building</p>
         <p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
         <p>In 2002, the Portland Public Communication building, the facility that houses 911 emergency services, required fairly routine renovations and additions that included new computer rooms, a new maintenance shop, and renovations and expansion to the existing office areas throughout the building. Considering that all emergency services for several large communities rely on the 911 emergency services in this building, no construction-related system or personnel disruptions would be acceptable. During the construction, through extensive coordination and planning, we were able to seamlessly transfer all mechanical systems without any break in emergency services.</p>
