Right now, we all have more questions than answers but there are some very good resources available to help as we navigate through these uncertain times. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ASHRAE, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers has a technical resource page dedicated to Covid-19. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/resources&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587321137501000">https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/resources</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Contained on this resource page is a guide for building operations during the pandemic and a link to an OSHA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration document on preparing workplaces for Covid-19.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ashrae.org/news/ashraejournal/guidance-for-building-operations-during-the-covid-19-pandemic&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587321137502000">https://www.ashrae.org/news/ashraejournal/guidance-for-building-operations-during-the-covid-19-pandemic</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3990.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1587321137502000">https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3990.pdf</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">OSHA states that there are three types of controls that can be utilized to reduce potential exposure to the virus. Those control types are engineering, administrative and PPE (personal protective equipment). Engineering controls are the only type that have measures that are manageable through your HVAC system. These measures include installation of high-efficiency air filters and increasing ventilation rates. Hunter-Davisson can evaluate and assist with both actions, but it will need to be done on a case by case basis since equipment types, models, etc. will influence what can be done and to what degree. For example, adding higher efficiency filters to a system increases the static pressure and may cause the system to exceed the static pressure capability of the motor in your equipment. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In addition to the measures outlined by OSHA, ASHRAE suggests that any demand-control ventilation (DCV) be disabled since DCV lowers the amount of outside air being provided into the building when population is lower. They also suggest running your systems longer, if possible 24/7 to increase the effective dilution ventilation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Please let us know if you have any questions or need any assistance in assessing your building and its systems to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. </span></p>
