          With a team of Project Managers, Project Engineers, Project Superintendents, Project Coordinators, over fifty field technicians and our own AB-QC department, HD specializes in providing quality construction for both design-build and plan-spec projects. Our Project Managers oversee projects while our on-site Project Engineers act as a conduit for information and are our main point of communication with our trade partners. Our Project Superintendents ensure that project milestones are being met and that each project is being constructed to rigid HD standards.  Our AB-QC personnel allows us to ensure that construction has been performed according to design and that systems are operating per specifications prior to occupancy. Our staff is well versed in working on everything from new construction to major renovation to small tenant improvement projects; always working towards and striving to be great team members and bring in another successful project.

Our utilization of BIM on projects has connected seamlessly with our prefabrication process. We have created 3D models using Revit and SysQue, detailing piping and sheet metal. We can then use the drawings to aid prefabrication of most piping and sheet metal in our shop. Our newly expanded sheet metal fab shop and newly constructed piping fab shop have assisted in keeping us competitive and on schedule.
