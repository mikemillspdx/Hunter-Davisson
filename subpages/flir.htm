 <h3>Overview:</h3>
 <p>FLIR Systems is the leading manufacturer of thermal and stabilizing camera systems. Partnering with Commercial Contractors in our role as a design build mechanical contractor, Hunter-Davisson was challenged to prepare FLIR’s headquarters in Wilsonville for lens coating equipment being relocated from Florida. Work included placement of a 2,100 lb. chiller on the roof and completing major remodeling inside the facility, while remaining invisible to production staff at FLIR. One of Hunter-Davisson’s biggest accomplishments of this project was using innovative solutions to ensure that the water tanks wouldn’t freeze in the winter without the use of antifreeze.</p>
